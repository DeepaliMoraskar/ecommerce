Layout Approach:
```
Added 
src/pages/Productcard.jsx
src/pages/ProductList.jsx
and displayed it under src/pages/Products.jsx
I used Bootstrapâ€™s grid system within the ProductList component to ensure each row displays
a maximum of 3 products (col-md-4). The Products page wraps the layout with a Navbar at the top,
the product grid in the middle, and a Footer at the bottom for a clean, modular structure.
```

Responsiveness Considerations:
```
The Bootstrap grid automatically adjusts the number of columns based on screen size,
so on smaller devices, products stack vertically (1 per row on mobile,
2 per row on small tablets), ensuring the UI remains user-friendly and
visually appealing across all device sizes.
```
